                My name is Nommel Isanar Lavapie Amolat. I am 19 years old and currently I am taking an undergraduate degree in Information Technology. The university where I am taking my course is Cavite State University - Bacoor City Campus. I live in Camella North Springville in barangay Molino III together with my father Filemon C. Amolat and my mother Imelda L. Amolat. As of now, I do not have a job as I am focused to my studies. But If opportunity permits, I will be glad to accept job offers to support my expenses as a student together with family needs.

                Above are the list of hobbies that I commit during my leisure, with "3D Modelling" being the most relevant or being occasionally done and "Drawing and Sketching" as the least committed activity.
            </p>
            <p class="sec_desc">
                "3D Modelling" is the thing that really drives me the most during my free time. This hobby captured me the moment I learned about it. I am quite done with face modelling, but could not finally finish it due to hectic schedule and lack of resources that are essential especially for a 3D artist. When boredom kicks in I also draw my attention to "Interactive Visual Novels." I really like the way I am being struck by a captivating story especially if it is not just a plain text of story, but rather interactive. In this way, I am becoming more inspired to create such interactive game in the future, if time and opportunity will permit of course. "Programming" is also one of the prevalent things that I do. As a bachelor of Information Technology it is quite inevitable to do such. A lot, like a bunch, of codes are needed to be done to be successful in my chosen path. "Photo Editing" and "Video Editing" are the things that I do sometimes especially if school projects or activities dive in. Through these I am able to express my artistry for both moving and static pictures. The least thing I do is "Drawing and Sketching." In reality, I only do this when I am at school, whenever a professor or instructor is not present yet or if there is a lot of vacant time to kill.

                The illustration above represents the different levels of careers where I see my path will lead to. Frankly speaking, these careers are probable guesses, as I for one do not know the appropriate or valid terms for the careers that I have been imagining, so some of these might not really be existing. So please bear with me for any flaws.
            </p>
            <p class="sec_desc">
                As you can see, the first step of the stair leads to me being a "3D Artist Intern." Others might think that being an intern is not a career at all, but for me it is a salient path just like any career. Also, If ever I will start my professional career, I want to initialiaze at the bottom as possible. Because very basic foundations are found in things that people sometimes take for granted, and I want to learn as much as very basic foundations so that I can have a robust grip along my path. The next career is as a "3D Artist Trainee." This will serve as a continuation of my learnt knowledge during my time as an intern. The real opportunity starts at me being a "3D Artist." In this phase, I expect a lot, like a lot. I do consider this as the time where I will be able to hone and showcase my knowledge and aptitudes about 3D art. Next one is me being a "Junior 3D Artist." This is the time where big changes start to kick in. I do expect that this phase will further develop my skills and talents as a 3D artist. "Senior 3D Artist" is the next opportunity after the latter career. I consider this phase as a game changer for my path, as having such position is already enough to tell that I am good at what I am doing. Being a "Lead 3D Artist" is like being really close to the apex of my path. This is more than enough for my career, but as they say, "One should keep on striving no matter what." Thus, that leads me to my ultimate dream at the current moment, and that is to become a "Visual Effects Supervisor." I guess all of my assimilated knowledge all throughout the path will be enough and appropriate for this. If not appropriate, I am hoping that my learnt knowledge will be transferrable somehow on to such final career.
